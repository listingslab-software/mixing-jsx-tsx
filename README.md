# Can we Mix JSX and TSX in the same React app?

> Aims to develop a Proof of Concept (POC) showing a react app can developed with both JSX and TSX at the same time

You'll see the tsx-baseline app app created with CRA, a bootstrapped app which we break apart using react's eject script

```bash
npx create-react-app tsx-baseline --template redux-typescript
cd ./tsx-baseline
npm eject
```
